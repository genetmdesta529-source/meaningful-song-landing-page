                <strong>[Verse 1: Olivia O'Brien]</strong><br>
                Feeling used<br>
                But I’m<br>
                Still missing you<br>
                And I can’t<br>
                See the end of this<br>
                Just wanna feel your kiss<br>
                Against my lips<br>
                And now all this time<br>
                Is passing by<br>
                But I still can’t seem to tell you Why<br>
                It hurts me every time I see you<br>
                Realize how much I need you<br>

                <strong>[Hook: Olivia O'Brien]</strong><br>
                I hate you I love you<br>
                I hate that I love you<br>
                Don’t want to, but I can’t put<br>
                Nobody else above you<br>
                I hate you I love you<br>
                I hate that I want you<br>
                You want her, you need her<br>
                And I’ll never be her<br>

                <strong>[Verse 2: Gnash]</strong><br>
                I miss you when I can’t sleep<br>
                Or right after coffee<br>
                Or right when I can’t eat<br>
                I miss you in my front seat<br>
                Still got sand in my sweaters<br>
                From nights we don’t remember<br>
                Do you miss me like I miss you?<br>
                Fucked around and got attached to you<br>
                Friends can break your heart too, and<br>
                I’m always tired but never of you<br>
                If I pulled a you on you, you wouldn’t like that shit<br>
                I put this reel out, but you wouldn’t bite that shit<br>
                I type a text but then I never mind that shit<br>
                I got these feelings but younever mind that shit<br>
                Oh oh, keep it on the low<br>
                You’re still in love with me but your friends don’t know<br>
                If you wanted me you would just say so<br>
                And if I were you, I would never let me go<br>
                I don’t mean no harm<br>
                I just miss you on my arm<br>
                Wedding bells were just alarms<br>
                Caution tape around my heart<br>
                You ever wonder what we coulda been?<br>
                You said you wouldn’t and you fucking did<br>
                Lie to me, lie with me, get your fucking fix<br>
                Now all my drinks and all my feelings are all fucking mixed<br>
                Always missing people that I shouldn’t be missing<br>
                Sometimes you gotta burn some bridges just to create some distance<br>
                I know that I control my thoughts, and I should stop reminiscing<br>
                But I learned from my dad that it’s good to have feelings<br>
                When love and trust are gone<br>
                I guess this is moving on<br>
                Everyone I do right does me wrong<br>
                So every lonely night, I sing this song<br>

                <strong>[Hook: Olivia O'Brien and Gnash]</strong><br>
                I hate you I love you<br>
                I hate that I love you<br>
                Don’t want to, but I can’t put<br>
                Nobody else above you<br>
                I hate you I love you<br>
                I hate that I want you<br>
                You want her, you need her<br>
                And I’ll never be her<br>

                <strong>[Bridge: Olivia O' Brien and Gnash]</strong><br>
                All alone I watch you watch her<br>
                Like she’s the only girl you’ve ever seen<br>
                You don’t care u never did<br>
                You don’t give a damn about me<br>
                Yeah all alone I watch you watch her<br>
                She’s the only thing you’ve ever seen<br>
                How is it you never notice<br>
                That you are slowly killing me<br>

                <strong>[Hook: Olivia O'Brien and Gnash]</strong><br>
                I hate you I love you<br>
                I hate that I love you<br>
                Don’t want to, but I can’t put<br>
                Nobody else above you<br>
                I hate you I love you<br>
                I hate that I want you<br>
                You want her, you need her<br>
                And I’ll never be her<br>

            <h2>Why This Song Matters To Me</h2>
            <p>
                This song reflects complex emotions of love and heartbreak.
                It reminds me that emotions are not always simple.
                The vulnerability in the lyrics and melody makes it deeply relatable.
